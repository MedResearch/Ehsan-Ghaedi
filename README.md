About Me
I am an independent researcher focused on solving complex challenges in the field of food science and nutraceuticals. My primary interest lies in engineering advanced formulations to stabilize bioactive compounds and enhance their biological efficacy. Using a multidisciplinary approach that combines food chemistry, process engineering, and computational simulations, I aim to create innovative platforms for the development of next-generation functional foods.   

🔭 Current Research: Developing a novel platform for ambient-temperature stabilization of Royal Jelly.

🌱 Always Learning: Constantly exploring the latest advancements in active compound delivery systems and pharmacokinetic modeling.

💬 Open to Collaboration: Interested in collaborating on projects related to natural ingredient stabilization, nutraceutical formulations, and functional foods.

🔬 Current Research Focus: Project Aegis
The Challenge: Royal Jelly, despite its extensive therapeutic properties, has limited commercial potential due to its severe chemical instability and the necessity of a cold chain for preservation.   

The Solution: Project Aegis is a multi-layered formulation and processing platform designed to overcome this challenge. The primary goal is to develop a Royal Jelly product with a minimum shelf life of 18 months at ambient temperature, coupled with enhanced bioavailability to maximize its therapeutic efficacy.   

Status: This project is currently confidential and in a pre-patent stage. Full details are managed within a private repository.
